### Architecture

In my full stack project, I used multiple types of frontend development methods, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and a single-page application (SPA). Express HTML provided a structured way to create dynamic server-rendered web pages with templates. JavaScript allowed us to add interactive elements to the frontend, improving user experience. Lastly, the SPA built with Angular enhanced performance and responsiveness by dynamically loading content without refreshing the entire page. This approach made the application faster and more modern compared to traditional multi-page applications.

For the backend, we used a NoSQL MongoDB database because it efficiently stores and retrieves JSON-like data structures. This format is highly flexible and perfect for applications with evolving data needs. MongoDB’s schema-less design also allows for quicker development, which made it ideal for this project.

### Functionality

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is different from JavaScript because it’s a lightweight data format used for data exchange between a client and server, while JavaScript is a programming language used to build functionality. JSON acts as the bridge that connects the frontend and backend by standardizing the data format for communication.

During the full stack development process, I refactored code in several ways to improve functionality and efficiency. For example, I replaced repetitive static HTML code with reusable Handlebars templates and Angular components. This reduced code duplication, made maintenance easier, and allowed us to scale the application more efficiently. Reusable UI components, like a header or a footer, saved time and ensured consistency across the project.

### Testing

Testing APIs in a full stack application involves verifying that endpoints correctly handle requests and responses. For example, we tested GET and POST requests to ensure they retrieved and sent data accurately. When security layers like authentication were added, testing became more complex because it required simulating authenticated users and verifying access control. Using tools like Postman, I was able to test endpoints and debug issues efficiently. Security measures such as token-based authentication ensured only authorized users could access certain parts of the application.

### Reflection

This course has been instrumental in helping me move closer to my professional goals. I’ve learned and developed key skills like building RESTful APIs, working with NoSQL databases, and developing modern frontends with Angular. These skills make me a stronger candidate for roles in web development because they’re in demand in the industry. Additionally, understanding the full stack process from start to finish has given me the confidence to take on more complex projects and solve real-world problems efficiently.
